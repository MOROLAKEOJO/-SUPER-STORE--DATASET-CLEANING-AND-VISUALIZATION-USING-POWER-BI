# "SUPER STORE" DATASET CLEANING AND VISUALIZATION USING POWER BI

POWER BI PROJECT using a fictitious retail dataset of a US-based “SUPERSTORE” over a three and a half year period.
Tool used: POWER BI

Tasks performed includes;
1. Data cleaning by removing NAN values from each columns, dropped duplicates and created new columns using POWER QUERY editor.

2. Created a calendar table using DAX functions like “Calendar and Format” to break down the date into days, months, quarter and years

3. Created new measures 

4.Inserted slicer to  filter chart and also used color function to monitor growth rate using red and green color indicator.

The Goal is to;
i.Determine the current performance of the company in different city and regions using DAX functions.
ii.Report and visualize company progress against KPIs.

WHY? This is done in order to use KPI to track long term performance of Superstore.

The First dashboard insight includes;
i.There was a reduction in the number of customers within 2014 and 2015 which result in 0% sales growth in 2015. However, there was 30% and 15% sales growth in 2016 and 2017 respectively.

ii.Superstore has being generating  more revenue on products under Consumer segment over the years compare to other segments.

iii.There’s a constant increase in total sales and profit over the quarters of the year except in 2017 where our profit is higher in Q1 than Q2 even though there’s an increase in sales.

iv.Most profit and revenues are made in North America,mostly in New York.

The Second and third dashboard shows regional sales and profit generated AND sales generated based on category and sub-category respectively. The insight includes;

i. Most profit was generated on copiers and losses was recorded on tables, supplies and bookcases which is due to the high discount rate placed on them.

ii.There’s increase in total sales in each quarter of the years except in 2016 where the sales in Q2 is a bit higher than sales in Q3.

iii.Even though there was a bit flunctuation in total sales in different category of products in each quarter of the year, there was always more sales in the last quarter Q4 of the year. Q4 is the most productive quarter of the year.

iv.We deduce from our chart that more sales and quantity supply does not equate more profit. There was high supply of binders, more sales on chairs but most profit was made on phones.
